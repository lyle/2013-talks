# Some of my 2013 Talks

In my role at 4D I am a Developer Advocate I speak a bit at meetups and conferences.

Here are my slides and notes for 2013. After the event I will add some more information about the talk to the slides so that they act a bit like a journal.

This repo is hosted as a website at http://2013-talks.lyle.troxell.com .
